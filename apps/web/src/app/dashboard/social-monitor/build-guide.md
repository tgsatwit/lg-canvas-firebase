## Key Feature Requirements

1. **Unified Comment Stream**: Display comments from Instagram, Facebook, and YouTube in a single feed
2. **Bulk Operations**: Select multiple comments and perform actions (reply, mark as answered) in bulk
3. **AI-Generated Replies**: Use OpenAI to generate contextually appropriate replies
4. **Customizable Responses**: Edit AI-generated replies before sending
5. **Platform-Specific Sending**: Send replies directly to the original platform
6. **Analytics Dashboard**: Track comment volumes, response rates, and average response time
7. **Filtering Options**: Filter by platform, answered status, date range, and engagement level
