I was introduced to these exercises by my 86 year old grandmother, and if you could see her you'd be doing these exercises every day too! She has a beautiful glow to her skin, it's absolutely flawless and smooth. She credits this all to her face exercise routine!

 Just like exercising other parts of your body, face exercises can help tone and strengthen the muscles in your face. Regular practice may lead to improved muscle tone, resulting in a firmer and more defined appearance.

They also increase blood circulation, reduce facial tension and stress, enhance facial symmetry, improve skin elasticity and best of all it is a 100% natural approach to beauty and wellbeing. 

This routine only takes 10 minutes per day, you can do it anytime, anywhere: watching TV, in the shower, waiting at the traffic lights or even standing in line at the supermarket (not for the faint hearted!)

Check out the entire routine and watch your face transform before your eyes!",651,https://api.vhx.tv/videos/2935575/files,2935575,https://online.pilatesbylisa.com.au/videos/complete-face-lifting-workout,"Complete Face Lifting Workout, face exercise, face exercises, face yoga, face workout",720,https://vhx.imgix.net/pbltest/assets/54d577d1-7501-4f61-9967-897f57d51020.png?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=crop&h=720&q=75&w=1280,1280,Complete Face Lifting Workout,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this routine we are working on the Powerhouse which is comprised of all of the muscles around the waistline. No need for the gym, timetables or traffic when you can do all your workouts from home! These ab strengthening, core sculpting, oblique chiseling moves will achieve incredible results!

This Pilates core circuit is designed to strengthen, define and tone all the muscles in your core. Traditional mat pilates with a twist, these exercises work the entire Powerhouse.

QUICK TIPS:

Rock’n’Roll: Pull the abdominal wall to the spine and initiate the movement from the pelvis, tucking under to propel your roll back onto your shoulders. Don't roll too far back onto the neck or head.

Oblique Twist: A little twist on the half roll down. Keep your spine in a c-curve throughout and always reach the underneath arm for the corner of the mat. Extend the opposite leg without moving the pelvis.

Toe Taps: Ensure the pelvis stays in neutral, keep your navel drawn into the spine and maintain a 90 degree angle at the knee throughout.

Dead Bugs: Extend the same arm and leg down towards the ground at same time, whilst simultaneously extending the opposite arm above the head.

We will be working our way from standing all the way down to the mat to stretch out every muscle from every possible angle!

Activities such as running, lifting heavy weights or jumping places excessive stress on the quadriceps. This ultimately leads to overuse of the quads and hip flexors during daily activities and also during exercise. If you've ever noticed the quads or hip flexors burning or tensing during certain exercises (for example, table top position) it means that they are too dominant and are taking all of the load that the hamstrings, core and glutes should be sharing too!

When quadricep muscles are overworked, they become tight and cause imbalance in the joints, particularly the knee. When tight quadriceps are accompanied by weak hamstrings, you have all the ingredients for an injury!

Too much sitting is another contributor to tight quads. When you sit at a desk for hours on end, your hip flexors shorten. Because all of the muscles connect to form a kinetic chain, tight hip flexors will also shorten the quads and cause them to be inflexible.

The ABC’s of an amazing PBL workout! 

Do you know my other ABC’s when it comes to our online workouts? ✅Athletic ✅Balanced ✅Clean: Athletic, challenging sequencing, balance and symmetry of the body and clean, precise, effective movement!❤️ 

Try this mini circuit for yourself! Perform 12 repetitions of each exercise for a total of three rounds, it covers the trifecta of fitness, cardio, strength and flexibility! 

Quick tips

1) 3-4 springs will keep the carriage stable whilst performing the sideovers, while the hip extensions and plyo pushups are most effective on one spring! 

2) Keep the extended arm beside the ear during sideovers to make sure the neck is staying aligned. 

3) Make a “tripod” with the supporting knee during hip extension, placing it directly in the centre for balance and control. 

4) Press the pelvis into the box and keep the spine neutral during plyo pushups, keep spring tension light as control trumps tension in this exercise!

For full length, real time, fully instructed reformer, matwork and apparatus Pilates classes that are the most effective blend of the classic method and contemporary moves, head to the online studio at www.pilatesbylisa.com.au.

Rotation is such a crucial aspect of the Pilates method as it strengthens the deep, intrinsic muscles that support the spine, creating the perfect marriage of strength and flexibility, which in turn creates even better flexion and extension. We can't have one without the other, and that’s why it’s so important that we concentrate on this often neglected plane of motion.
This workout is designed to improve our range of rotation. Practicing rotation feels incredible, you will see and feel the benefits right away! Improved rotation will allow you to achieve greater mobility not only in your Pilates practice, but also in day to day activites and sports that require rotation.

,,2025-05-16T12:27:25.355Z,"Pilates is so much more than abdominal exercises that involve heavy flexion of the spine. A well rounded Pilates workout incorporates flexion, extension, lateral flexion and rotation in order to create a healthy, flexible spine. Rotation is such a crucial aspect of the Pilates method as it strengthens the deep, intrinsic muscles that support the spine, creating the perfect marriage of strength and flexibility, which in turn creates even better flexion and extension. We can't have one without the other, and that’s why it’s so important that we concentrate on this often neglected plane of motion.

This workout is designed to improve our range of rotation. Practicing rotation feels incredible, you will see and feel the benefits right away! Improved rotation will allow you to achieve greater mobility not only in your Pilates practice, but also in day to day activites and sports that require rotation.

We can't have one without the other, and that’s why it’s so important that we concentrate on this often neglected plane of motion.

This workout is designed to improve our range of rotation. Practicing rotation feels incredible, you will see and feel the benefits right away! Improved rotation will allow you to achieve greater mobility not only in your Pilates practice, but also in day to day activites and sports that require rotation. This is an excellent workout for golfers, tennis players, footballers and swimmers!","[object Object], [object Object], [object Object], [object Object], [object Object]",1200,321171600,https://vimeo.com/321171600,Ultimate Flexibility: Rotation,https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/764114387-0e1efd55276ee776c03e138b2eaa40a54b26acd33bc2641b96bf5367b0157447-d_295x166?&r=pad,"[object Object], [object Object], [object Object], [object Object], [object Object], [object Object], [object Object]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Carpal Tunnel is a passage way that is formed by bones and ligaments that allows the median nerve and tendons to run through, when the tendons become thickened or there is any impingement on the Median Nerve, this will cause the syndrome. 

Symptoms of Carpal Tunnel can be tingling, numbness and pain in the hand and can progress to the point where surgery is required. The condition can be caused by repetitive actions such as sitting at a computer and typing or using a mouse and also during pregnancy water retention can impinge on the nerve.

Using minimal equipment—a booty band and a chair—this routine is designed to tone muscles, improve stability, and enhance flexibility, making it perfect for a balanced and efficient workout.

Workout Structure:
5-Minute Upper Body Booty Band Workout
Move on to your upper body with a booty band routine that targets the arms, shoulders, and back. The resistance from the band adds intensity, helping to build lean muscle and endurance.

5-Minute Standing Ab Workout
This segment focuses on strengthening and toning your entire midsection, improving posture and stability.

5-Minute Knee and Lower Body Strength with Chair and Booty Band
Next, focus on lower body strength, emphasising knee stability. Using a chair for support and a booty band for resistance, this segment strengthens the quads, hamstrings, glutes, and calves, improving overall lower body functionality.

5-Minute Lower Body Focus
Continue the lower body work with exercises specifically designed to lift and tone the glutes and inner thighs. Glute bridges and inner thigh lifts provide a concentrated burn for a sculpted lower body.

Using minimal equipment—a booty band and a chair—this routine is designed to tone muscles, improve stability, and enhance flexibility, making it perfect for a balanced and efficient workout.

Workout Structure:
5-Minute Upper Body Booty Band Workout
Move on to your upper body with a booty band routine that targets the arms, shoulders, and back. The resistance from the band adds intensity, helping to build lean muscle and endurance.

5-Minute Standing Ab Workout
This segment focuses on strengthening and toning your entire midsection, improving posture and stability.

5-Minute Knee and Lower Body Strength with Chair and Booty Band
Next, focus on lower body strength, emphasising knee stability. Using a chair for support and a booty band for resistance, this segment strengthens the quads, hamstrings, glutes, and calves, improving overall lower body functionality.

5-Minute Lower Body Focus
Continue the lower body work with exercises specifically designed to lift and tone the glutes and inner thighs. Glute bridges and inner thigh lifts provide a concentrated burn for a sculpted lower body.

5-Minute Spinal Mobility Workout
Transition into a gentle spinal mobility segment to improve flexibility and relieve tension.

,,2025-05-16T12:27:23.001Z,"Here is a sneak peek at my Anti Aging Facial Pilates Routine!

I was introduced to these exercises by my 80 year old grandmother, and if you could see her you'd be doing these exercises every day too! She has a beautiful glow to her skin, it's absolutely flawless and smooth. She credits this all to her facial exercise routine!

Your facial muscles play a critical role in the contouring and shaping of your face. These exercises increase circulation, improving the blood flow to your face to give you a healthy glow.
